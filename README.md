# OSCP Preparation

## Sections

## Prerequisites
* 1 part Windows admin - know how to turn services on and off, add users, change passwords, browse through cmd and windows explorer, RDP, etc.
* 1 part Linux experience - Know how to move around directories, read files, create files, use a text editor (linux essentials or linux+ prep courses will help)
* 1 part LAN networking - TCP/IP knowledge, ports, arp, wireshark/tcpdump familiarity, firewalls (host and network)
* 1 part security knowledge - general attack classes, goals, major OS vulns over the past 20 years; pen test course or book works
* 1/2 part Kali experience - poke around it a bit, experience installing to it, logging in, location of some tools and the interface
* 1/2 part Metasploit knowledge - have used it a bit, run through the free Metasploit Unleashed course
* 1/2 part web server/client knowledge - nice to have hosted anything with apache/iis in the past and understand config files, ports, php/javascript a little
* 1 part coding/scripting logic/basics - if you can make a bash/perl/powershell/c/python script or have coded in the past enough to read and minorly edit script/code chunks; nothing amazing
